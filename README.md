# React-js
This repository serves as my playground for learning React.js. Here, you'll find a collection of projects, exercises, and code samples that I've worked on as I explore the world of React. 


# 05passwordGenerator
In this project we deal with the generation password.
we have different option to generate password like 
* User can decide the `length` of the password
* User can decide to include or not `numbers` in password
* User can decide to include or not 'characters` in passwod
* By default the `numbers` , `characters` are notincluded and `length` is of 6
* We have a copy button to copy the generated password

 In summary , i have learnt about the `useEffect()` , `usef()` and `callCallback()` in the world of `React`
